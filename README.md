    Website using AWS/Cloud Resume Challenge
I made this website as part of the Cloud Resume Challenge. Below are the resources that I used. This website is hosted on AWS using a serverless architecture. The visitor counter uses a API which was created in the AWS service API gateway. Every time a person visits my website the API gets provoked which then invokes a lambda function that writes the value to a Dynamodb table. I also used github actions with terraform to create a CI/CD deployment of this website. CloudResumeChallengeWebsite
